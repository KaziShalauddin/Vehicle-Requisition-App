Vehicle-Requisition-App

Project Title : Requisition Management System

Introduction: Save time and eliminate paperwork by automating the requisition Process. Authorize Users can submit their requisition by using web Interface. Automate the entire process including Requisition which is currently doing by Paperwork. As well as Employee, Driver, Vehicle also save as Database which is play an important role in any organization.

Overview of Functional Requirements:

Authorized users must be able to login with their identification number or user name and password.
After a successful login the user only view and do an operation which is authorized by the system controller.
After the login user (Employee) may do some operations, Like- submit a request, view request, Delete or cancel the request, etc.
After the login user (Vehicle Controller) may do some operations, Like- approve a request, assign vehicle on request, cancel or delete request, etc.
Security System:

Only Authorized user will be permitted to access the system. This system will provide the user’s with a secure way to change their password and personal information.

Goal:

Eliminate paperwork and efficient process by Web requests to multiple Employees at a time. Track all Vehicle, Driver and Employees Information by clicking.

What problem it will solve?

Empower your Employees with self-service procurement.
Increase the percentage of Requisition with specific purpose of using vehicle.
Cost effective, save time, Easy to maintain.
Gain visibility to all requisition and their approvals.
What is vision and mission for software? Mission:

Enable Requisition to focus on strategic objectives and realize operational efficiencies with technology that promotes great user experience.

Vision:

To establish e-requisition as the go-to provider with innovative and affordable regional solutions.

Scope of the System:

The project aims at providing an efficient interface to the BCC for managing their vehicle requisition based on current manual process in automate. The basic idea involved here is that vehicle and employee, driver are stored in a database. When system get a requisition request, the system analyzes the schedule, vehicle, availability of driver in database and send it to the vehicle manager (admin) for approval.

We also propose to include a feature “Feedback”. This feature keeps track of any objection from vehicle user or any inquiry to the vehicle manager and also from vehicle manager to the vehicle user about any instruction.

The Domain:

This proposed project aims at vehicle requisition management of BCC. It can be used in large domain would result in an equally as large scope of development. To keep that in mind we kept our software case study client BCC as organization and where it can also add any branch organization.

The Client:

Our software will allow our client to customize create user dynamically. Our client can apply our software another branch of it to minimize task on a very large scale.

The User: The main users of the product would be employee and requisition related personnel and also driver. The vehicle controller would approve the requisition that would be sent out, provide necessary information as feedback. User Such Employee can edit their profile photo or password only and other information of profile will be handled by vehicle manager only. As per requisition requester I able to request and cancel or have inquiry. Many of these tasks, such as the information regarding Employee, vehicle, and driver would need to be set only once. Of course, the option to add, remove, or update this data would be implemented as well. Once this initial step has been taken, our software will require nothing more than an approval for the requisition being sent out, minimizing the work that management has to complete handle the request by approve or cancel the request. User Type:

Employee (will request requisition)
Vehicle Manager (will request handle)
System Admin (can control everything in system)
Stakeholder:

Employee
Driver (get notified followed by requisition)
Vehicle Requisition handle related personnel. Feature:
Requisition for vehicle as per request seat.(scenario:1)
Requisition available time=>as per scheduled time.
Request make for other user.(scenario:2)
Multiple car assign as per single request.(scenario:1)
Re-assign request(by manager): if available later(scenario:3)
Role wise permission => create, view, delete.
Scenario: Scenario 1:

User Mr. A can request n No. of seat for in a requisition: based on that appropriate vehicle approve. Or if it’s exceeded the number of seat in available car the multiple vehicle assign per that request. Scenario 2:

User Mr. A can request for Mr. B in a requisition: based on that it will be as Requested by Mr. A for Mr. B a vehicle requisition has requested.

Senerio3:

User Mr. A can requested a vehicle but it not available in present thus its cancel be vehicle manager, but after sometimes later vehicle available and it’s within requester requested time.
